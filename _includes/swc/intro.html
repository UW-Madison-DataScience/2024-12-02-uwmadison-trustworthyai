This lesson equips participants with trustworthy AI/ML practices, emphasizing fairness, explainability, reproducibility, accountability, and safety across three general data/model modalities: structured data (tabular), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. Participants will learn to evaluate and enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of models in each modality. Additionally, they will explore how to integrate these principles into future models, bridging ethical practices with practical applications in their research.</p>
